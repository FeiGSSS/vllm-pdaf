# PAP Claim Ledger

This file records claim maturity separately from experiment evidence grades.

## Claim maturity

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `hypothesis` | Falsifiable statement with no supporting experiment yet |
| `observed` | Supported by preliminary or single-run evidence |
| `supported` | Repeated and causally tested within the stated conditions |
| `paper-ready` | Supported across the generality required by the manuscript |
| `falsified` | Contradicted by authoritative evidence |
| `superseded` | Replaced by a more precise claim |

## Active claims

| ID | Claim | Conditions | Status | Evidence | Counterevidence | Next falsification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C01 | Multi-PA completion skew amplified by the fan-in join dominates the current 7PA1P latency loss relative to 6PA2P. | Same eight-GPU model, request trace, concurrency, runtime mode, and valid participant-count accounting. | `hypothesis` | Existing reports and traces require admission audit. | Matched-shape summaries indicate that 7PA1P forward execution can be faster; Projection and workload effects remain unresolved. | Attribute at least half of the matched ITL gap to measured skew and reduce the gap with an equal-load intervention. |

### C01: Fan-in amplification limits 7PA1P scaling

- **Statement:** Multi-PA completion skew, amplified at the Projection fan-in
  join, is the dominant cause of the current 7PA1P latency loss relative to
  6PA2P.
- **Conditions:** Same eight-GPU model, request trace, concurrency, runtime
  mode, and valid participant-count accounting.
- **Status:** `hypothesis`
- **Paper section:** Background and Motivation; Scheduling and Placement.
- **Supporting evidence:** Pending admission audit.
- **Counterevidence:** Existing summaries report faster matched-shape 7PA1P
  forward execution, while Projection and workload effects remain unresolved.
- **Falsification condition:** Measured fan-in skew explains less than half of
  the matched E2E ITL gap, or an equal-load intervention does not materially
  narrow the gap.
- **Next test:** Reconstruct per-layer PA completion and join distributions
  from authoritative matched traces before collecting new evidence.

## Entry requirements

Each claim must:

1. be precise enough to falsify;
2. state the workload, model, hardware, topology, and SLO conditions that bound
   it;
3. link supporting and contradictory PAP experiment IDs;
4. distinguish observed correlation from causal evidence;
5. identify the manuscript section and the next test needed for promotion.

Use the following shape when adding an entry:
