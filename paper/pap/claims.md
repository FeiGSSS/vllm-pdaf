# PAP Claim Ledger

This file records claim maturity separately from experiment evidence grades.

## Claim maturity

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `hypothesis` | Falsifiable statement with no supporting experiment yet |
| `observed` | Supported by preliminary or single-run evidence |
| `supported` | Repeated and causally tested within the stated conditions |
| `paper-ready` | Supported across the generality required by the manuscript |
| `falsified` | Contradicted by authoritative evidence |
| `superseded` | Replaced by a more precise claim |

## Active claims

| ID | Claim | Conditions | Status | Evidence | Counterevidence | Next falsification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C01 | Multi-PA completion skew amplified by the fan-in join dominates the current 7PA1P latency loss relative to 6PA2P. | Same eight-GPU model, request trace, concurrency, runtime mode, and valid participant-count accounting. | `falsified` | PAP-20260729-RESEARCH-L01: the median spread delta accounts for only 3.20 ms per 36-layer step, 16.6% of the trace-mode ITL gap. | Same-shape Projection and paged-Attention kernel medians are topology-neutral; trace synchronization also inflates the measured 7PA1P gap. | Reopen only if a non-intrusive matched run attributes at least half of the gap to completion skew. |
| C02 | A non-intrusive phase model explains at least 75% of the 7PA1P versus 6PA2P ITL gap from Decode load aggregation. | Qwen3-8B FP16 eager, eight L20 GPUs, current reduced multi-turn workload, matched concurrency and clean code. | `falsified` | PAP-20260729-RESEARCH-L02: the remote stage explains 88.2% of the complete-forward median difference. | The complete-forward difference explains only 62.6% of the trace-off ITL p50 gap, leaving a scheduler/cadence residual above the registered 25% limit. | Reopen only with request-aligned, non-intrusive evidence that closes the residual. |
| C03 | Fixed-concurrency 7PA1P/6PA2P latency comparisons confound topology with achieved throughput; at about 9.3 req/s, 7PA1P retains materially lower TTFT with comparable mean ITL and SLO goodput. | Same dataset and runtime, 7PA1P C20 versus 6PA2P C32, achieved throughput within 5%, two clean repetitions. | `hypothesis` | Historical same-dataset pilots place 7PA1P C20 and 6PA2P C32 near 9.3 req/s. | Pilot 7PA1P mean ITL is 8--11% higher and strict-SLO pass/fail is unstable. | Reject if throughput cannot be matched within 5%, TTFT improves by less than 40%, mean ITL is more than 12% worse, or standard/relaxed goodput is lower. |

### C01: Fan-in amplification limits 7PA1P scaling

- **Statement:** Multi-PA completion skew, amplified at the Projection fan-in
  join, is the dominant cause of the current 7PA1P latency loss relative to
  6PA2P.
- **Conditions:** Same eight-GPU model, request trace, concurrency, runtime
  mode, and valid participant-count accounting.
- **Status:** `falsified`
- **Paper section:** Background and Motivation; Scheduling and Placement.
- **Supporting evidence:** `PAP-20260729-RESEARCH-L01`.
- **Counterevidence:** The median fan-in spread delta explains only 16.6% of
  the trace-mode ITL gap. Matched-shape Projection and paged-Attention kernels
  are topology-neutral.
- **Falsification condition:** Measured fan-in skew explains less than half of
  the matched E2E ITL gap, or an equal-load intervention does not materially
  narrow the gap.
- **Next test:** Reopen only if non-intrusive matched evidence attributes at
  least half of the ITL gap to completion skew.

### C02: Non-intrusive load-aggregation model

- **Statement:** A non-intrusive phase model explains at least 75% of the
  7PA1P versus 6PA2P ITL gap from Decode load aggregation.
- **Conditions:** Qwen3-8B FP16 eager on eight L20 GPUs, current reduced
  multi-turn workload, matched concurrency, and clean committed code.
- **Status:** `falsified`
- **Paper section:** Motivation; System Model; Evaluation.
- **Supporting evidence:** `PAP-20260729-RESEARCH-L02` shows roughly 3x larger
  Projection forwards in 7PA1P. Its remote stage explains 88.2% of the
  complete-forward median difference.
- **Counterevidence:** The complete-forward median difference is 3.49 ms,
  only 62.6% of the trace-off ITL p50 gap. The unexplained 37.4% exceeds the
  registered residual limit.
- **Falsification condition:** A non-intrusive phase model leaves more than
  25% of the matched ITL gap unexplained, or a material topology-specific
  penalty remains after matching Projection batch, PA rows, and KV load.
- **Next test:** Reopen only with request-aligned non-intrusive evidence that
  closes the scheduler/cadence residual.

### C03: Compare PAP topologies on a throughput-latency frontier

- **Statement:** Fixed client concurrency compares different achieved
  throughput points. At about 9.3 req/s, 7PA1P retains materially lower TTFT
  with comparable mean ITL and SLO goodput relative to 6PA2P.
- **Conditions:** Same Qwen3-8B workload and runtime; 7PA1P C20 versus 6PA2P
  C32; achieved request throughput within 5%; two clean repetitions.
- **Status:** `hypothesis`
- **Paper section:** Evaluation Methodology; End-to-End Performance.
- **Supporting evidence:** Two historical same-dataset 7PA1P C20 pilots
  produced 9.35--9.38 req/s versus the clean 6PA2P C32 result of 9.30 req/s.
  Their mean TTFT was 0.63--0.65 s versus 1.67 s.
- **Counterevidence:** Pilot 7PA1P mean ITL remains 8--11% higher, and its
  strict-SLO result changes across repetitions.
- **Falsification condition:** Reject if achieved throughput differs by more
  than 5%, 7PA1P TTFT improves by less than 40%, mean ITL is more than 12%
  worse, or standard/relaxed goodput is lower.
- **Next test:** Run two clean repetitions of 7PA1P C20 and 6PA2P C32 using
  the byte-identical L02 dataset and trace disabled.

## Entry requirements

Each claim must:

1. be precise enough to falsify;
2. state the workload, model, hardware, topology, and SLO conditions that bound
   it;
3. link supporting and contradictory PAP experiment IDs;
4. distinguish observed correlation from causal evidence;
5. identify the manuscript section and the next test needed for promotion.

Use the following shape when adding an entry:
